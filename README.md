Sound-Final

Monkeys come towards the player with different speeds, the goal is to attack them when they get close.
The Big blue line marks the attack range, and the closest blue line marks the losing range

A bomb will come towards the player, the bomb will not harm the player but must be careful to not blow it up
Allowing the bomb to get close or disarming it will reset the bombs position. Attacking the bomb will
cause it to detonate

If a bomb blows up or a Monkey reaches the player the game will end and the player will lose
